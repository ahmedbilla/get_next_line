# get_next_line

get_next_line is a C project that involves implementing a function that reads a line from a file descriptor. The goal of the project is to create a custom function that handles reading a single line of text from a file, managing memory efficiently, and supporting multiple file descriptors.

Key features of get_next_line:

Reads one line at a time from a file or standard input.
Handles dynamic memory allocation to store the line.
Efficiently processes large files without reading unnecessary data.
Manages multiple file descriptors.
The project helps developers learn about file handling, memory management, and the use of system calls like read in C.
